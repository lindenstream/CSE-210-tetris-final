For our project we remade the game of Tetris.
- Each of the seven Tetris pieces are children classes of the parent class 'Piece'
- The 'Traits' class contains the methods to initialize a list of blocks, rotate those blocks, and get the current position/image of those blocks
- The 'Tetris' class contains methods to direct the game and move it in order
- The main.py file contains the main function to set up the pygame characteristics and run the game

List of classes:
(1) BlockI
(2) BlockJ
(3) BlockL
(4) BlockO
(5) BlockS
(6) BlockT
(7) BlockZ
(8) Piece
(9) Traits
(10) Tetris

Other files:
(1) main.py
(2) constants.py
